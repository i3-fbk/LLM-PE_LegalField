# LLM-PE_ in Legal terms and Conditions Contracts

This repository contains a corpus of annotated contract clauses, specifically terms and conditions, which can be utilised for fine-tuning language models (LLMs) and testing prompt engineering approaches. The corpus has been accepted for presentation at the LREC COLING Conference 2024.

## Overview

The corpus consists of a collection of contract clauses along with their corresponding annotations, categorizing them into various legal categories. This resource may be valuable for researchers interested in natural language processing in the legal domain.

## Usage

Researchers and developers can utilize this corpus for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:

- Fine-tuning language models for legal text binary and multi-label classification.
- Training and evaluating classification models for legal clause categorization.
- Exploring prompt engineering techniques for improving the effectiveness of language models in legal contexts.
