LLM-PE_ in Legal Terms and Conditions Contracts
===============================================

This repository contains the corpus of annotated terms and conditions clauses that have been used for fine-tuning two language models (LLMs) and testing a prompt engineering approach for the paper "[Annotation and Classification of Relevant Clauses in Terms-and-Conditions Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14457)" presented at LREC/COLING Conference 2024.

Overview
--------

The corpus consists of a collection of contract clauses along with their corresponding annotations, categorizing them into various legal categories. This resource is available to researchers interested in natural language processing in the legal domain.

Usage
-----

Researchers and developers can use this corpus for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:

-   Fine-tuning language models for legal text binary and multi-label classification.

-   Training and evaluating classification models for legal clause categorization.

-   Exploring prompt engineering techniques for improving the effectiveness of language models in legal contexts.
